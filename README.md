# logback-changelog-generator
This Repository generates a changelog file for logback so it can be parsed by tools like renovate

# Why?
I use renovate and annoyed that logback publishes its changelogs on a html page.

To fix this this script generates a changslog entry for every entry on the html page where logback publishes their changelog https://logback.qos.ch/news.html
